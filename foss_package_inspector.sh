# Script 2: FOSS Package Inspector
# Author: Bipanchi Kalita | Course: Open Source Software
# Registration No: 24BOE10046
# Description: This script checks whether the chosen software (Python) is
#              installed on the system, finds its version, and uses a case
#              statement to print philosophical notes about various FOSS packages.
# Concepts Used: if-then-else, case statement, command substitution,
#                rpm/dpkg commands, pipe with grep, command -v
